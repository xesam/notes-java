#Comparator

Sometimes we want to compare objects that do not implement the Comparable interface,
or to compare objects using a different ordering from the one specified by that interface.

The ordering provided by the Comparable interface is called the natural ordering,
so the Comparator interface provides, so to speak, an unnatural ordering.
